## Summary

In this sample we show you how to use the [JavaScript API for Office](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b27e70c3-d87d-4d27-85e0-103996273298(v=office.15)) to write data to a set of custom XML parts that are bound to content controls within a Word document. The following is a  picture of the scenario in question.

![Screenshot of running sample](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8550529/9298298/4b980684-4461-11e5-8c00-8f86701e55c2.PNG)

We are creating packing slips from customer order data. The packing slip document is shown on the left of the preceding screen shot, with our Office Add-in on the right as a task pane app. When you select an order using the order id drop-down in the task pane on the right and then click the Populate button, the packing slip document is populated with data from that order.  The sample uses the Javascript API for Office to interact with the Word document by populating custom XML parts defined in the document with order data. These custom XML parts are bound to content controls that define the UI or the document. To simplify this sample, the order data is stored in the same JavaScript file that creates the add-in. However, in a real application, that data could come from a data source anywhere on the web.

## Prerequisites
This sample requires the following:  

  - Visual Studio 2013 with Update 5 or Visual Studio 2015.  
  - Word 2013 or later
  - Internet Explorer 9 or later, which must be installed but doesn't have to be the default browser. To support Office Add-ins, the Office client that acts as host uses browser components that are part of Internet Explorer 9 or later.
  - One of the following as the default browser: Internet Explorer 9, Safari 5.0.6, Firefox 5, Chrome 13, or a later version of one of these browsers.
  - Familiarity with JavaScript programming and web services.

## Key components

This solution was created in [Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/fp179827.aspx#Tools_CreatingWithVS). It consists of two projects - InvoiceManager and InvoiceManagerWeb. Here's a list of the key files within those projects. 
#### InvoiceManager project

* [InvoiceManager.xml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Word-Add-in-JavaScript-InvoiceManager/blob/master/InvoiceManagerSample/InvoiceManagerManifest/InvoiceManager.xml) The [manifest file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/jj220082.aspx#StartBuildingApps_AnatomyofApp) for the Word add-in.
* [PackingSlip.docx](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Word-Add-in-JavaScript-InvoiceManager/blob/master/InvoiceManagerSample/PackingSlip.docx) The example packing slip Word document used in this sample. 

#### InvoiceManagerWeb project

* [Home.html](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Word-Add-in-JavaScript-InvoiceManager/blob/master/InvoiceManagerSampleWeb/App/Home/Home.html) The HTML user interface for the Word add-in.
* [Home.js](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Word-Add-in-JavaScript-InvoiceManager/blob/master/InvoiceManagerSampleWeb/App/Home/Home.js) The JavaScript code used by Home.html to interact with Word using the JavaScript for Office API.

## Description of the code

For a detailed description of this sample, see [Exploring the JavaScript API for Office: Data Binding and Custom XML Parts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn166930.aspx)

<a name="build"></a>
## Build and debug
1. Open the InvoiceManager.sln file in Visual Studio.
2. Press F5 to build and deploy the sample add-in and open it in Word.
3. On the **Home** ribbon, find the **Invoice Manager** group and press the **Open** button.
3. In the app task pane, select an order in the Order ID drop-down list.
4. Choose Populate to populate the packing slip in the Word document with information from the selected order.


You can view a list of the custom XML parts in a document by opening the XML Mapping pane in Word (Developer tab).

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
## Troubleshooting

- If the add-in starts with a blank document, ensure that the **Start Document** property of the InvoiceManager project is set to *PackingSlip.docx* and not just to Word.

- If the add-in does not appear in the task pane, Choose **Insert > My Add-ins >  InvoiceManagerSample**.
